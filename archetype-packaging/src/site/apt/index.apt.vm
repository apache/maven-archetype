Maven Archetype Packaging

   This is '<<<maven-archetype>>>' packaging configuration for archetype projects. It provides
   {{{../maven-archetype-plugin}maven-archetype-plugin}} bindings to default lifecycle:

   * {{{../maven-archetype-plugin/jar-mojo.html}archetype:jar}} to <<<package>>> phase,

   * {{{../maven-archetype-plugin/integration-test-mojo.html}archetype:integration-test}} to <<<integration-test>>> phase,

   * {{{../maven-archetype-plugin/update-local-catalog-mojo.html}archetype:update-local-catalog}} to <<<install>>> phase.

   []

   in addition to classical resource/jar/install/deploy. See {{{./archetype-packaging.html} Archetype Packaging Reference}}
   for details.

Usage

   Declaring <<<maven-archetype>>> packaging to your pom is not the only step required:

   * to be available from an the archetype project, the packaging must be added as an extension,

   * to ensure a reproducible build, the archetype plugin version needs to be locked down in pluginManagement section.

   []

   Typical <<<pom.xml>>> contains:

+---
<project>
  ...
  <packaging>maven-archetype</packaging>
  ...
  <build>
    <extensions>
      <extension>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.archetype</groupId>
        <artifactId>archetype-packaging</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
      </extension>
    </extensions>

    <pluginManagement>
      <plugins>
        <plugin>
          <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
          <artifactId>maven-archetype-plugin</artifactId>
          <version>${project.version}</version>
        </plugin>
      </plugins>
    </pluginManagement>
  </build>
</project>
